# The Urban Tree Canopy Cover in Brazil

This is the pytorch codes for our paper: [The Urban Tree Canopy Cover in Brazil - Nationwide Perspectives from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](https://nkszjx.github.io/projects/UTB.html).
To better service Brazilâ€™s urban ecosystem, we developed a semi-supervised deep learning method, which is able to learn semantic segmentation knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled images, to segment urban trees from high spatial resolution remote sensing images. The approach attains significant improvement over existing methods, especially when trained with limited labeled samples. Using this approach, we created 0.5 m fine-scale tree canopy products for 472 cities in Brazil and made them freely available to the community ([UTB dataset](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fi6bKCTtg5Xfnx9qYzMWnV/); Password: 1949).

In this study, we used the same semi-supervised learning framework to train two CNN models for urban tree and mask segmentation, respectively. 
We use [Deeplabv3+](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch) (Chen et al., 2018) as our segmentation network (a). 
A standard binary classification network was designed as the discriminator (b) in this semi-supervised adversarial learning framework.
